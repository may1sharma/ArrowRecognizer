# How to RUN
You can toggle the variable at Line 18 of File "index.html" in order to work on 
the entire feature list or the selected subset. Open the file "index.html" in a 
web browser, the processing will start showing a counter on the screen. After 
all the features are calculate, it will open a pop-up to save the features.csv 
file. You might want to rename it depending on the feature list you have selected
so as not to get confused in several files stored at same place. The generated 
can be processed in "Weka" tool for classification purposes.
